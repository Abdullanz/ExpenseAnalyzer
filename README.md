# FinancialAnalyzer
المحلل المالي || تطبيق ويب لتحليل الأمور المالية


## Description
This project is an Open Source project to spread financial awareness among people it is built as a MERN Application. I am building it to learn about concepts and technologies like; Continuous Integration, React, and strengthens my MongoDB abilities. I am generally using Embedded JavaScript to and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model to create the project, but currently I am at the initial stage of development. The application is considered as a 3-tier application architecture.

## Use Cases
The main use case is for the indviduals who are looking to invest, but do not hold the knowledge to decide whether they can invest, or should save money before investing. This application supports the concept of risk management for the indviduals are looking to build a diverse financial portfolio.

## Environment Specs

ExpressJS (Version 4.17.1)

Mongoose (Version 5.9.17)


## User Interface Design
I am currently implementing the Front-End using the Neumorphism approach. I like the concept of minimlism in providing a simple and stright forward user experience with a touch of sophistication.

## Run it locally
first, please install all the dependencies.

Secound, node app.js, then the app will be running locally at the (localhost: 3000).


## Testing

Mocha

Chai


## Roadmap V2
In the next version I am going to implment an API within the project to specify which investments are best to each of the tiers avaliable in the application. Also, I will improve the User Interface, and experince significantly by making it more user friendly. 

Security is definitely going to a major priority for the next version, since I will also focus on testing and security threats. Also, I am going to improve the process of verfication and authentication systems for the users. This is a big aspect of creating a robust solutions for financial web applications.

Finally, adding features like; payment system to sponsor the project, data analytics system, and autogenerating a more articulate auto-generated reports is a must however it depends on the complexity of these systems and learning about them. Therefore, I will possibly add two of them and then decide to implement the third on the next version
